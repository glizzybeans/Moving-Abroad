# Ever since I studied abroad in college, I've always dreamed of moving abroad. A couple of my favorite places I've visited over the years would be Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia
# 
# For this project I will compare the cost of living where I currently live in Lexington KY to a comparable sized city in each of those countries. is there a country I could move to in Europe that I could live on the same salary I make in the states. where would my money go further, where would my money goes less. 
# 
# The most important measures to me: are rent prices for a 2 bedroom apartment, transportation costs, healthcare, grocery prices. 
# 
# I mainly just need to know the amount of money I'd need to make to live comfortable, not lavish or extratrodinare. 
# 
# I am college educated, but don't carry a professional degree like someone who can practice law, engineer, nurse, doctor. 
# 
# 
# I will compare the currency and find out which country would be the most logical answer to my question. I will do it by City, then by country and then by index
# 
# I think a heat map would be best for this, to visualize affordability to non. I am considering a bar chart as well. maybe for the Quality of Life one.
